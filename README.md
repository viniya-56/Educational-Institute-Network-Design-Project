## Educational Institute Network Design Project 
 
This repository contains the design documentation for a computer network intended for a fictional educational institute with five departments. The project utilizes Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and verification of packet transfer between connected devices. 
 
### Project Goals: 
 
* Design a scalable and secure network infrastructure to support 2500 devices (500 PCs per department). 
* Implement dynamic IP address allocation using a DHCP server. 
* Integrate a DNS server for efficient domain name resolution, allowing access to the institute's website. 
 
### Software Used: 
 
* Cisco Packet Tracer (for network simulation) 
 
### Report Structure: 
 
The provided report outlines the designed network in detail, including: 
 
1. Introduction: An overview of the project scope and the description of the problme statement. 
2. Network Fundamentals and Technologies: A theoretical explanation of DHCP, DNS, computer networks, and how departments connect within a network structure. 
3. Methodology: The approach taken to design the network, encompassing requirements gathering, topology selection, device selection, addressing scheme design, security considerations, network management strategy, documentation, and testing (if applicable). 
5. Results: Obtained results after successful implementation of the network. 
 
Getting Started: 
 
* Refer to the included report (CN_Project-Report.pdf) for the comprehensive network design documentation. 
* Also, the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file CN_Project.pkt is invcluded in this repository.
